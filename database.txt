"Wow! Jennifer Lopez!" This line comes from the Chinese dubbed version of the YouTube advertisement for the online game "Coin Master." The story describes Jennifer Lopez suddenly appearing in a supermarket and asking the cashier, "Shirley?" Upon seeing the superstar, Shirley exclaims in surprise, "Wow! Jennifer Lopez!" In the next moment, Jennifer Lopez demands, "Did you just attack my village?" Shirley responds, "Uh, probably. You came all the way here just because I attacked your village?" To cover up the fact that she came all the way to the supermarket just because her village was attacked, Jennifer Lopez grabs a pineapple from a nearby customer and says, "I also... came for this!" The commercial ends with a voiceover.
